<p><strong>Why I Chose KBTU </strong></p>
<p>
  When I started thinking about universities, KBTU (Kazakh-British Technical University) quickly became my top choice.
  Its reputation for academic excellence, modern facilities, and the opportunity to learn from the best professors made it my dream.
  I also heard amazing stories from current students, which motivated me even more.The preparation process was intense and challenging.
  I spent countless hours studying mathematics, English, and other key subjects.
  Balancing schoolwork, extra preparation, and personal life was far from easy.
  Some days felt overwhelming, especially when I doubted whether I was doing enough.
  However, I kept reminding myself of my goal: getting into KBTU.
  To stay organized, I created a schedule and broke my studies into smaller tasks.
  This approach helped me focus on one step at a time. My family and friends also supported me,
  encouraging me when I felt like giving up.</p>

<p>The first day at KBTU felt like stepping into a new world.
  The modern classrooms, the welcoming atmosphere, and meeting new people made me realize I had made the right choice.
  I was a bit nervous at first, wondering if Iâ€™d fit in or manage the coursework.
  But as the day went on, I felt more at ease. The professors were approachable, and my classmates were friendly and supportive.</p>
<p>Something excited happened.</p>

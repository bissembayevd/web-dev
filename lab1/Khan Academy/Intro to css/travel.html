    <p>Astana, formerly known as Nur-Sultan, Akmolinsk, Tselinograd, and Akmola,
        is the capital and second-largest city of Kazakhstan with a population of 1,350,228 within the city limits after Almaty,
        which had been the capital until 1997. The city lies on the banks of the Ishim River in the north-central part of Kazakhstan,
        within the Akmola Region, though administered as a city with special status separately from the rest of the region.
        Initially founded as Akmoly in 1830, the city was later renamed Akmolinsk, Tselinograd,
        and Akmola before adopting the name Astana in 1998, which means "capital city" in Kazakh.</p>

        It is about 1.6 kilometers long, 1 kilometer wide, and 30 meters deep. The water in the lake is always cold,
